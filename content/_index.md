# <<>> Shubham Shah <<>>

I am Shubham, a craftsman deeply intertwined with the infinite expanse of the digital realm. My diverse interests drive me to explore new and exciting journeys, from the nuances of business in the digital space to the magic of programmable money and the joy of memes and art.

Currently, I am a devoted disciple of [Buildspace Nights and Weekends S3](https://buildspace.so), and my work remains shrouded in secrecy.

## <<>> Best Work <<>>
I have crafted several marvels, including
* [Lyfmemo](https://lyfmemo.vercel.app/), a powerful tool capable of autoclassifying quick jots,
* [Cubetimer](https://cubetimer.vercel.app/), a timer and statistic tracker for those who seek to solve the Rubik's cube,
* [Cydekyk](https://cydekyk.vercel.app/), a store powered by the Solana chain, and
* [Nocap](https://gtihub.com/shubhxms/nocap), a case converter CLI
all of which shall live on in the annals of history.

In times gone by, I have also served as a disciple of [Buildspace Nights and Weekends S2](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xb78eeb255a386d49f7d00859568370da52566184400727c4baa4fdf8c7dd6210).

## <<>> Collaboration <<>>
I am always delighted to collaborate with others from different domains who share my passions on the internet. Reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shubhxms) and [Telegram](https://telegram.me/shubhxms) at [@shubhxms](/links).

## <<>> Other <<>>
As a 19-year-old computer science student hailing from Gujarat, I am a student of [Ahmedabad Uni](https://ahduni.edu.in). My interests lie at the intersection of technology and freedom, and I strive to live my life in accordance with my core values.

I spend my days immersed in learning and creating new things in the boundless expanse of the internet while ever mindful of the importance of using free and locally oriented software.

## <<>> Now <<>>
As the great cosmic wheel of time turns, I sit at my workstation, tapping away at the keys of my machine, channeling the power of the divine into the creation of new wonders. Each keystroke is a note in the grand symphony of creation, weaving a tapestry of endless possibility.

May the blessings of the divine guide my hand, and may the fruits of my labor be a testament to the power of the human spirit.

May the digital realm continue to inspire us all, and may our creations bring joy and wonder to those who behold them.
