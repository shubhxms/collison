sup shubham here! i am an internet-native builder. i primarily spend my time making craft with code. i am interested in many things including web-apps, internet businesses, memes, programmable money, free and open software, & literature.

these days i primarily spend my time learning more about backend (specifically APIs and databases), programmable money and reading random stuff on internet dot com [^1]. see [/now](/now) for more details.

i currently run an arch-based distro with KDE desktop environment [^2] on my machine and have a preference towards using free and local-first software [^3].


## best work

in the past i have built some interesting stuff, the best of which includes:
* [lyfmemo](https://lyfmemo.vercel.app/) - app to autoclassify quick jots
* [cydekyk](https://cydekyk.vercel.app/) - store on solana chain
* [nocap](https://gtihub.com/shubhxms/nocap) - case converter CLI

i was also a part of [buildspace nights and weekends s2](https://buildspace.so/nights-weekends)

## other
i am 19yo and a cs major @ ahmedabad uni. i grew up in ahmedabad, gujarat (where my body is currently stationed as i live on the internet).

my interests are at an intersection of technology and freedom. i strive to live my life in such a way that i experience as much as i want to and act according to my core set of values.
