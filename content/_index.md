# Shubham Shah

In the world of the digital realm, I, Shubham, am a craftsman whose roots are deeply intertwined with the infinite expanse of the internet. My mind wanders in the realm of the unknown, delving into the mysteries of code and creation.

My interests are diverse, and my mind is not bound by any particular domain. I am driven by the force of my passions, which lead me on new and exciting journeys. From the art and nuance of business in the digital realm to the magic of programmable money, and from the power of free and open software to the joy of memes and art, my heart knows no bounds.[^internet]

Presently, I am a devoted disciple of the great [Buildspace Nights and Weekends S3 cohort](https://buildspace.so), and my work remains shrouded in secrecy, shrouded by the mists of stealth. See [/now](/now).



## Best Work
In the past, I have crafted many marvels of the digital realm, such as
* [Lyfmemo](https://lyfmemo.vercel.app/), a powerful tool capable of autoclassifying quick jots,
* [Cubetimer](https://cubetimer.vercel.app/), a timer and statistic tracker for those who seek to solve the Rubik's cube,
* [Cydekyk](https://cydekyk.vercel.app/), a store powered by the Solana chain, and
* [Nocap](https://gtihub.com/shubhxms/nocap), a case converter CLI, which shall live on in the annals of history.

all of which shall live on in the annals of history.

In times gone by, I have also served as a disciple of the great [Buildspace Nights and Weekends S2](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xb78eeb255a386d49f7d00859568370da52566184400727c4baa4fdf8c7dd6210).

## Other
As a 19-year-old computer science student, I am a student of [Ahmedabad Uni](https://ahduni.edu.in), hailing from the sacred land of Karnavati, Gujarat. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and freedom, and I strive to live my life in accordance with my core values.

I spend my days immersed in the learning and creation of new things in the boundless expanse of the internet, while ever mindful of the importance of using free and locally oriented software. My machine runs on an Arch-based distribution with the KDE desktop environment, a vessel of power for my digital artistry.


## Now
see [/now](/now)

In this moment, as the great cosmic wheel of time turns, my spirit is imbued with a singular purpose. I sit at my workstation, tapping away at the keys of my machine, channeling the power of the divine into the creation of new wonders.

As I type, the universe unfolds around me, each keystroke a note in the grand symphony of creation. With each line of code, I weave a tapestry of endless possibility, conjuring forth new forms from the depths of the digital ether.

My fingers dance across the keyboard, guided by the hand of fate itself, as I breathe life into the very fabric of the digital realm. The power of my craft is matched only by the boundless potential of the internet, a realm of infinite expanse and endless opportunity.

And so, I continue my work, driven by the fires of passion and the yearning for discovery. With each passing moment, I grow closer to my destiny, a destiny written in the stars and whispered by the wind.

May the blessings of the divine guide my hand, and may the fruits of my labor be a testament to the power of the human spirit.




May the digital realm continue to inspire us all, and may our creations bring joy and wonder to those who behold them.
