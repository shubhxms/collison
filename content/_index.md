sup shubham here! i am an internet-native builder. i primarily spend my time making craft with code. i am interested in many things, primarily — internet businesses, programmable money, free and open software, memes & art [^art] — and i am very domain agnostic and enjoy working on whatever it is that holds my interest.

[^art]: as in consuming art; i can assure you, i have the utmost disdain for analysis of art.

i am a part of [buildspace nights and weekends s3](https://buildspace.so/) and shipping [stealth] as of now.

these days i primarily spend my time making stuff or learning random stuff on internet dot com [^internet]. see [/now](/now) for more details.

[^internet]: see [/shelf](/shelf) and my [telegram broadcast](https://telegram.me/shubhamcore)


i currently run an arch-based distro with KDE desktop environment [^garuda] on my machine and have a preference towards using free and local-first software [^web-apps].

[^garuda]: [garuda linux](https://garudalinux.org/)
[^web-apps]: i also like web-apps a lot. it is not a dichotomy; both have their proper places

## best work

in the past i have built some interesting stuff, the best of which includes:
* [lyfmemo](https://lyfmemo.vercel.app/) - app to autoclassify quick jots
* [cubetimer](https://cubetimer.vercel.app/) - timer and stats for rubiks cube solves
* [cydekyk](https://cydekyk.vercel.app/) - store on solana chain
* [nocap](https://gtihub.com/shubhxms/nocap) - case converter CLI

i was also a part of [buildspace nights and weekends s2](https://buildspace.so/)

## other
i am 19yo and a cs major @ [ahmedabad uni](https://ahduni.edu.in). i grew up in ahmedabad, gujarat (where my body is currently stationed as i live on the internet).

my interests are at an intersection of technology and freedom. i strive to live my life in such a way that i experience as much as i want to and act according to my core set of values.
