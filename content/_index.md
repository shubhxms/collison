sup shubham here! i am an internet-native builder. i primarily spend my time making craft with code. i am interested in many things including web-apps, scripting, programmable money, internet businesses, literature, tennis, drinking coconut water..

i am learning more about the backend and programmable money these days and that is my primary focus, see /now

the labels i currently fit the most are those of a frontend developer,  a builder, and a meme connoisseur internaut. (yes, i use the infamous oxford comma)

i am 19yo and a cs major @ ahmedabad uni. i grew up in ahmedabad, gujarat (where my body is currently stationed as i live on the internet). my interests are at an intersection of  indian tech twitter scene, indie-builders, TPOT, and academia-aesthetics-enthusiasts. i strive to live my life in a way such that i develop a set of core values and experience as much as i can.
